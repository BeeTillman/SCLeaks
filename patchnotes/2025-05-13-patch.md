# Star Citizen Alpha 4.1.1 – LIVE Release (May 13, 2025)

## Official Patch Notes

*(Below are the official patch notes for Alpha 4.1.1, as released by CIG on May 13, 2025.)*

Alpha Patch **4.1.1** has now been released onto the LIVE environment! Launcher should now show: **VERSION 4.1.1-LIVE.9764168**.

**Build Info:**
Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence (LTP) data. (Note: Certain player states such as personal hangar layouts, custom characters, in-progress refinery jobs, and in-game purchased consumables are **not** saved between releases, which may cause some items to be lost during the update.)

### Feature Updates (4.1.1 Highlights)
- **Invictus Launch Week 2955:** The annual Fleet Week event is now live at Area18, including **Invictus event halls** and free-fly activities. Expo halls will rotate every 7 hours throughout the event.
- **New Missions – Ship Combat:** Introduced **Ship Battle Missions (V1)** such as Patrol, Ambush, and **Gilly’s Advanced Combat Gauntlet**, offering challenging multi-ship space combat scenarios.
- **Dynamic Missions:** Added new mission types like **“Handyman” maintenance missions** and **Animal transport missions**, expanding the range of contract types available to players.
- **PvP Bounty Hunting:** Players can now encounter **PvP bounty missions**, where player targets are marked for bounty across the system.
- **Idris Capital Ship Tour:** An interactive **Idris tour** is available during Invictus—players can board a UEE Idris and explore it during special event windows.
- **Tutorial Updates:** A new **UEE Navy Training simulation** has been added as a tutorial mission, introducing new players to advanced flight and combat mechanics.
- **Spectrum Chat Integration:** In-game chat is now integrated with Spectrum (CIG’s web platform), enabling **cross-platform chat** between the game and Spectrum channels.
- **Miscellaneous:** New **reward items** (“Wikelo” reward series) have been added for event participation, and various QoL improvements were implemented (e.g., UI updates, map clarity).

<summary><strong>Bug Fixes (Click to expand)</strong></summary>

- **Stability Improvements:** Fixed multiple client crashes and server deadlocks to improve overall stability in the PU.
- **Quantum Travel:** Resolved an issue where quantum travel sometimes failed to **align or spool** properly, which could prevent ships from jumping [oai_citation:2‡youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B8zxlN22ms#:~:text=Experience%20www,align%20or%20spool%20Bed).
- **Bed Logout:** Fixed a bug where players who bed-logged in ships would sometimes awaken without their ship (or in unusual locations).
- **Elevators:** Improved elevator functionality – expo hall elevators should no longer remain greyed out and trap players inside (a workaround in PTU was to respawn at a hospital, but this should be addressed now).
- **Ships and Vehicles:** Various ship bugs were addressed, such as turrets not syncing correctly and a mining bug that prevented resource scanning (notably improving the mining gameplay experience).
- **Trading Terminals:** Fixed errors with trade terminals not completing commodity sales under high server load.
- **Performance:** Optimizations made to entity streaming and server network throughput, reducing frame drops during high-activity events (like Fleet Week crowds).
- *(Many other minor bugs were fixed across missions, user interface, and environment graphics.)*

**Known Issues:** *(Persistent issues still present in 4.1.1)*
- **ASOP Terminals:** Occasionally, ship retrieval terminals may time out or fail to spawn ships.
- **Elevator Doors:** In rare cases, some elevator doors (station elevators) stay closed when they should open – relogging can bypass this.
- **Inventory Desync:** Player inventory may appear empty after transferring items (the items are still there – reopening the inventory UI fixes it).
- *(A detailed list of known issues is available on the official site. Players should refer to the RSI **Known Issues** page for 4.1.1 for more.)*
